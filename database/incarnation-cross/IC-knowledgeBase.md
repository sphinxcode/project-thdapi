## Understanding Incarnation Crosses

The Incarnation Cross represents approximately **70% of a person's energetic design** and defines their life's purpose and direction. It is calculated from four key positions at birth:

**The Four Gates**:
1. **Personality Sun** (Conscious Sun) - What you identify with
2. **Personality Earth** (Conscious Earth) - What grounds you
3. **Design Sun** (Unconscious Sun) - Your underlying drive
4. **Design Earth** (Unconscious Earth) - Your unconscious foundation

**Format**: Cross Name (Personality Sun / Personality Earth | Design Sun / Design Earth)

Example: Right Angle Cross of The Sphinx (13/7 | 1/2) means:
- Personality Sun: Gate 13
- Personality Earth: Gate 7
- Design Sun: Gate 1
- Design Earth: Gate 2

## The Sphinx (4 variations)

### 1. Right Angle Cross of The Sphinx (1/2 | 7/13)
**Gates**: 1 (Self-Expression), 2 (Higher Knowledge), 7 (The Role of the Self), 13 (Listener)

You are here to follow your own lead and be in the moment. You are transfixed by the now and your way of doing things. This self-absorption is your individual contribution to the world. While it is not your intention to give others direction, you do. By following your heart and doing your own expressive thing, others can find direction through your example and will follow. Do your own thing and make sure it is your passion to your core.

### 2. Right Angle Cross of The Sphinx (2/1 | 13/7)
**Gates**: 2 (Higher Knowledge), 1 (Self-Expression), 13 (Listener), 7 (The Role of the Self)

The energy of this Cross is to see and be open to the possibilities. You are here to guide us by showing us the many possible directions and ways to create a beautiful world. You point out the many possible roads we may choose to take or give suggestions for alternate routes. However, you may have difficulty explaining why to take that suggested route.

### 3. Right Angle Cross of The Sphinx (7/13 | 2/1)
**Gates**: 7 (The Role of the Self), 13 (Listener), 2 (Higher Knowledge), 1 (Self-Expression)

As the Cross of the Sphinx you bring leadership to guide and direct as your energy supports vision for the future. This is probably the most active Cross of seeking leadership, but the drive for leadership in you will depend on your profile and the rest of your chart's composition. Fundamentally, you have the design to look at past patterns and project where they are moving to. This is your greatest asset to bring forth in your leadership.

### 4. Right Angle Cross of The Sphinx (13/7 | 1/2)
**Gates**: 13 (Listener), 7 (The Role of the Self), 1 (Self-Expression), 2 (Higher Knowledge)

## Laws (4 variations)

### 1. Right Angle Cross of Laws (3/50 | 60/56)
**Gates**: 3 (Ordering), 50 (Values), 60 (Acceptance), 56 (Stimulation)

You have the energy that drives you to have laws. As a young child with this Cross if there were not rules and laws in your house, you may have found the scenario disturbing. This Cross is about living out the laws of the tribe. The lead energy has mutative qualities so there is the drive to make the laws better, but this is not revolutionary energy. The lead energy has more of a gradual change, as the law has limitations. If these limitations were to change drastically, it would feel like chaos.

### 2. Right Angle Cross of Laws (56/60 | 3/50)
**Gates**: 56 (Stimulation), 60 (Acceptance), 3 (Ordering), 50 (Values)

You are here to speak about ideal laws. Your energy is driven to have rules and regulations and you will talk or dream about how to create them. You are here to promote change through your vision of what is possible and expression of how it will be structured with rules. You will not be motivated to speak to the details of the structure, but you will be inspired to share the dream and how it will make things better.

### 3. Right Angle Cross of Laws (50/3 | 56/60)
**Gates**: 50 (Values), 3 (Ordering), 56 (Stimulation), 60 (Acceptance)

Your Cross has the energy of making laws for the tribe. In order for a tribe to survive, someone needs to hunt or gather the food, someone needs to cook the food and then there needs to be order around who consumes the food and how that is done. Now many of us are a long way from the campfire days, but the principles still hold. Your gift is to set the rules so the family, community or organization can function in a productive, less chaotic way and achieve greater organization.

### 4. Right Angle Cross of Laws (60/56 | 50/3)
**Gates**: 60 (Acceptance), 56 (Stimulation), 50 (Values), 3 (Ordering)

Your Cross has the energy and holds the boundaries of laws. You understand that laws are important because they maintain order and hold our society together. Your energy is bound to the traditional laws or the older customs. In general, lawmaking is an evolutionary process. You are here to provide that stabilizing force and remind us of the rules that help hold us together.

## Explanation (4 variations)

### 1. Right Angle Cross of Explanation (4/49 | 23/43)
**Gates**: 4 (Formulization), 49 (Principles), 23 (Assimilation), 43 (Insight)

Your Cross is driven by the energy of the 4th gate which is "the answer", but this answer is really just a theory that has to be expressed and then verified. You are here to explain your theories and this is a bit of a challenge. The explanation you give will be individualistic and for a logical theory to be accepted, it needs to appeal to the collective. Your mission is to give the rest of us an uncommon explanation, one that most of us wouldn't think of.

### 2. Right Angle Cross of Explanation (23/43 | 49/4)
**Gates**: 23 (Assimilation), 43 (Insight), 49 (Principles), 4 (Formulization)

You are here to vocalize individual expression. Because it is individual expression, it is new to the collective and your audience may act as if what you are saying is strange or bizarre. You therefore have built-in energy to repeat what you have said or done over and over again. It is through this process of repetition that the rest of humanity (or at least friends and family) begin to become familiar with what you are expressing.

### 3. Right Angle Cross of Explanation (43/23 | 4/49)
**Gates**: 43 (Insight), 23 (Assimilation), 4 (Formulization), 49 (Principles)

Your Cross has the energy that is driven to provide explanation to the world. This is not always an easy task because you are trying to explain what you already know. This is very individual knowing and as others are trying to understand, you may want to stop and just say, "I know, because I know!" More likely, you will continue because you are driven to get this information across.

### 4. Right Angle Cross of Explanation (49/4 | 43/23)
**Gates**: 49 (Principles), 4 (Formulization), 43 (Insight), 23 (Assimilation)

Your Cross carries revolutionary, mutative energy. This energy has tension and aggression because it is emotional. Providing food plays a large role in this Cross and you have the drive that gets us to take action to provide for our bodies' need to be nourished. The Cross is called explanation because there is pressure to explain what your mutation is all about.

**Gates**: 5 (Fixed Rhythms), 35 (Change), 64 (Confusion), 63 (Doubt)

You are here to be in the flow of life. All of life is made up of patterns that dance in the river of time. Your energy is the basis of these patterns. You have an inherent gift to understand that it is all about the patterns in life, in nature, and in the universe. If we go with the flow, then our energy is reserved for experiencing the things that move in and out of our lives and is not spent trying to fight the current.

### 2. Right Angle Cross of Consciousness (35/5 | 63/64)
**Gates**: 35 (Change), 5 (Fixed Rhythms), 63 (Doubt), 64 (Confusion)

You are here to balance the energies of desire to have an experience and be done with it. Your motto is "been there, done that." As situations arise in life, many times you may realize that you have experienced something similar before so you don't need to go through all the effort to do that all again.

### 3. Right Angle Cross of Consciousness (63/64 | 5/35)
**Gates**: 63 (Doubt), 64 (Confusion), 5 (Fixed Rhythms), 35 (Change)

The energy of your Cross is here to ask questions and examine patterns to find a deeper understanding. Questions like, "Is everything ok with this or is it working itself out?" You are driven to ask the questions from a logical perspective of why we are at a particular place with a certain issue or situation.

### 4. Right Angle Cross of Consciousness (64/63 | 35/5)
**Gates**: 64 (Confusion), 63 (Doubt), 35 (Change), 5 (Fixed Rhythms)

## Eden (4 variations)

### 1. Right Angle Cross of Eden (6/36 | 12/11)
**Gates**: 6 (Friction), 36 (Crisis), 12 (Caution), 11 (Ideas)

So you were thrown out of Eden, or at least that may be what birth felt like to you. Many who carry this Cross enter the world reluctantly as the womb provides everything that is needed. Over time, you carry the energy to go out and explore the world and to live life. Ultimately your energy is about exploration, not to make your way back to Eden but to move forward and find a slice of Eden here on earth and then share it with those around you.

### 2. Right Angle Cross of Eden (11/12 | 6/36)
**Gates**: 11 (Ideas), 12 (Caution), 6 (Friction), 36 (Crisis)

We come into body from the ethereal world that has a lightness and a lack of density. This world is dense and has a heaviness to it. You are here to educate and pass on the importance of the body experience. You come in on the Cross of Eden and are here to express this philosophy while being in body.

### 3. Right Angle Cross of Eden (12/11 | 36/6)
**Gates**: 12 (Caution), 11 (Ideas), 36 (Crisis), 6 (Friction)

Your Cross has the energy and drive to go and explore the world -- but it really isn't just about you. This is the energy that compels you to bring others along on your exploration. This is the force that led us out of the Garden of Eden. This energy also has ties to art and bringing expression into form.

### 4. Right Angle Cross of Eden (36/6 | 11/12)
**Gates**: 36 (Crisis), 6 (Friction), 11 (Ideas), 12 (Caution)

The energy you carry is about being thrown out of Eden and then rediscovering it. Many people on this Cross will come into life and either feel they have been tossed out of paradise (heaven) or have an experience early in life that leaves them feeling Eden was lost. Your energy provides the drive to go seek your own Eden through experience.
