# HUMAN DESIGN VARIABLES: ENVIRONMENT
## The 6 Environmental Colors - Where Your Body Thrives

---

## WHAT IS ENVIRONMENT IN HUMAN DESIGN?

Your **Environment** is the external condition and surroundings where your physical body is nurtured, protected, and operates at its optimal frequency. It's **NOT** about moving to a specific place, but about creating the right energetic conditions around you.

**Location in Chart:**
- Derived from your **Design Nodes** (North & South Node)
- Specifically the **Color** beneath the line
- Bottom LEFT arrow in your chart
- Part of the **Independent Variable** (most foundational)

**Critical Understanding:**
Environment is about **WHERE** your body thrives, while Determination is about **HOW** your body processes. Together, they create your Primary Health System (PHS).

## TIMING: WHEN ENVIRONMENT BECOMES CRITICAL

**Quote from Ra Uru Hu:**
*"The environment is the final stage, the final platform in being able to establish the final battle, which is with mind. This is an enormously important stage in the life."*

### BIRTH TO SATURN RETURN (~0-29):
- Environment can provide **support** but is not critical
- Focus should be on Strategy, Authority, and Determination
- Children benefit from environmental considerations
- Body is still developing

### POST-SATURN RETURN (~30+):
- Environment becomes **ESSENTIAL** ingredient
- Body is ready to resonate to correct environment
- Without it, transformation cannot complete
- This is when you're ready for the "final stage"

**Quote from Ra:**
*"According to Ra, it's only when you become an adult, usually after your saturn return, that your environment becomes an essential ingredient for you in your life."*

## THE LEFT-RIGHT BINARY IN ENVIRONMENT

### LEFT ARROW = THE OBSERVED

### RIGHT ARROW = THE OBSERVER

**Quote from Ra:**
*"If you're not in the right environment you'll see that they're not. But if you're in the right environment, you are in your process, the focus of the left, it is others who are looking at you. But if you're on the right, you're the one looking and you're not noticed."*

---

## COLOR 1: CAVES
**KEYNOTE:** Fear â€¢ Security â€¢ Protection â€¢ Control â€¢ Enclosed Spaces

### CORE ESSENCE
The Cave environment is about **safety, security, and control.** Historically, caves were places to hide from elements and dangers - one way in, one way out. This is the most primitive and foundational environmental need.

*"Caves: A Secure Environment. One Entrance. The environment is there to nurture us."*

---

---

## COLOR 2: MARKETS

## COLOR 6: SHORES
**KEYNOTE:** Innocence â€¢ Transitions â€¢ Boundaries â€¢ Edges â€¢ Contrasts

## ENVIRONMENT & FREQUENCY: THE CONNECTION

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:**

Your Environment will NOT work correctly unless you have the right **FREQUENCY.**

**Frequency comes from:**
1. Living your **Strategy & Authority**
2. Following your correct **Determination** (PHS)
3. This creates body frequency that **resonates** to environment

**Quote from Ra:**
*"It is your frequency in the environment. It is these things together because you cannot separate them. You don't see that through the terminology tonally in the sense that in looking at Valleys, you're not seeing that in the context of the Narrow or the Wide, you see it here, because this is about a body in space."*

**What This Means:**
- You can't "think" your way into correct environment
- You can't force environment without correct PHS
- Environment emerges naturally when body is correct
- The body **resonates** to its environment when frequency is right

---

## ENVIRONMENT & YOUR DETERMINATION

**Your Environment depends on your Determination being correct.**

**Quote from Ra:**
*"In other words, if you're not in a supportive Environment, the nutrition you require for optimal potential is simply not available to you."*

**The Relationship:**
- **Determination** creates internal correctness
- **Internal correctness** creates proper frequency
- **Proper frequency** resonates to correct Environment
- **Correct Environment** nurtures the body
- **Nurtured body** supports mind's potential

**Sequence:**
1. Strategy & Authority
2. Determination (Internal PHS)
3. Frequency develops
4. Environment (External PHS) becomes accessible
5. Body fully supported
6. Mind can function correctly

## COMMON MISTAKES & MISCONCEPTIONS

**MISTAKE:** "I need to move to match my environment"
**TRUTH:** Environment is about quality and energy, not location. You can create environmental conditions anywhere.

**MISTAKE:** "I'll work on my environment right away"
**TRUTH:** Environment only works after Strategy, Authority, and Determination are established. It's the FINAL stage.

**MISTAKE:** "My environment type doesn't resonate"
**TRUTH:** If it doesn't resonate, you're likely not operating correctly yet through S&A and PHS. Give it time.

**MISTAKE:** "I have to live at a literal cave/market/mountain/etc."
**TRUTH:** These are archetypes and energy qualities, not literal locations (though some people do live at literal versions).

**MISTAKE:** "Environment will fix everything"
**TRUTH:** Environment is ONE piece of a holistic transformation process. It's powerful, but only when built on correct foundation.

---

## ENVIRONMENT & RELATIONSHIPS

Your correct environment affects **WHO** you meet and **HOW** you meet them.

**Quote from Ra:**
*"The moment you look at things differently, you travel a different road. It's like the difference between the vegetarian and the carnivore. They travel a different road; they have to. And there is a difference between the left and the right and the way in which they move through life."*

**Different Environments attract different people:**
- Caves attract those who value their selectivity
- Markets attract those who value variety
- Kitchens attract community-minded people
- Mountains attract those who value perspective
- Valleys attract communicators
- Shores attract transitional thinkers

---

## ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH

**Your environment directly impacts your health and longevity.**

**Quote from Ra:**
*"The environment is there to nurture us. The fact is that both dietary regimen and environment are deep healing processes."*

**When in Wrong Environment:**
- Increased resistance
- Health problems
- Unclear thinking
- Feeling unsupported
- Meeting wrong people
- Can't access proper nutrition (literally and metaphorically)

**When in Correct Environment:**
- Natural ease and flow
- Better health
- Clear awareness
- Feel supported and nurtured
- Meet right people
- Proper nourishment available

---

## FINAL WISDOM

**Quote from Ra Uru Hu:**
*"Nobody is really ready for the environment until their bodies have been healed through correct Strategy and Authority and proper dietary regimen, because you have to have the equipment. Environment is the final stage, the final platform in being able to establish the final battle, which is with mind."*

**The Truth:**
- Environment is POWERFUL but must be approached correctly
- It's the final stage in transformation
- It requires patience and foundational work first
- When correct, it changes EVERYTHING
- It's where body and mind finally align

**Your Environment is:**
- Where you're meant to thrive physically
- The external nourishment for your form
- The stage upon which your life unfolds
- The key to unlocking your full potential
- The final piece of the holistic transformation

---

**Remember:** You are designed to resonate to your environment when your body is operating correctly. Trust your Strategy and Authority, experiment with your Determination, and your Environment will naturally call to you when the time is right.
