# The Complete Guide to Human Design & Material Success
## Translating Ra Uru Hu's "64 Material Ways" into Practical Application

---

# PART 1: THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

## The Core Premise: How Money Actually Works in Human Design

Ra Uru Hu's teaching on money is built on a provocative foundation that most people miss:

**"You make money FROM the not-self, THROUGH the not-self."**

This doesn't mean exploiting people. It means understanding that:
1. Your **open (undefined) centers** are where you gain WISDOM about what others need
2. Your **defined centers** are where you have CONSISTENCY to deliver value
3. The **3rd Line of every gate** contains the material/money theme for that gate

### The Mechanism Explained

When you have an **open center**, you experience that center's themes inconsistentlyâ€”you sample them from everyone around you. Over time, this creates WISDOM about how that center operates for others.

**The Transformation:**
- **Before deconditioning**: Open centers control your decisions (not-self behavior)
- **After deconditioning**: Open centers become WISDOM centers that allow you to understand and serve others

**Key Insight**: The material plane is dominated by the not-self. To make money, you must understand what the not-self needs and provide genuine value to address those needs.

# PART 4: THE 3rd LINE PRINCIPLE

## Why the 3rd Line Is the "Money Line"

Ra taught that the 3rd Line of EVERY gate represents its material/money theme. The 3rd Line profile embodies:

1. **Martyr Behavior** - Learning through trial and error
2. **Anarchist Attitude** - Recognizing what doesn't work and tearing it down
3. **Pessimism Perspective** - The built-in doubt that drives material concern
4. **Sustainment Role** - The aspiration to maintain and grow
5. **Bonds Made and Broken** - The reality of contracts and partnerships

### The Material Wisdom of the 3rd Line

**"The 3rd Line discovers what doesn't work. That's why it can be materially successfulâ€”it discovers what doesn't work and improves it."**

This creates the cycle of "new and improved" that drives commerce.

# PART 5: PRACTICAL APPLICATION

## How to Use Your Open Centers for Material Success

### Step 1: Identify Your Open Centers
Look at your BodyGraph. Which centers are WHITE (undefined/open)?

### Step 2: Recognize the Wisdom Potential
Each open center has become a place of WISDOM through your life experience. You've sampled every variation of that center's theme from others.

### Step 3: Transform Not-Self to Service
Instead of your open center driving your decisions, let it become a SERVICE to others who struggle with that center's themes.

**Example**: Open Heart Center
- NOT-SELF: "I have to prove myself constantly"
- WISDOM: "I understand everything about the need to prove worth"
- SERVICE: "I can help others find their worth without exhausting themselves"

### Step 4: Follow Strategy and Authority
**CRITICAL**: All of this only works if you're making decisions correctly for your Type. The material plane will NOT reward not-self decision making.

- **Generators**: Wait to respond
- **Projectors**: Wait for recognition and invitation
- **Manifestors**: Inform before acting
- **Reflectors**: Wait a lunar cycle

### Step 5: Seven-Year Cycles
Business and material success operate in 7-year cycles. Every 7 years:
- Evaluate what's working
- Transform what isn't
- Adapt or die

# PART 6: THE DEEPER WISDOM

## "Make Your Living Through Being Correct"

Ra's ultimate teaching on money:

**"The only way you cannot be stained by [making money from the not-self] is that you must be correct."**

When you operate correctly:
- You attract the right opportunities
- You provide genuine service
- Whatever you receive is clean
- You get what you deserve

**"I know that just as I teach people who enter into Design that you can turn your mind into your own ally, I know that you can use the very techniques to attract the not-self to change the not-self, to wake it up, to transform it. But you have to be correct in that."**

## The Ultimate Irony

Ra acknowledged the profound irony of teaching this material:

**"I'm saying to you that you can make money by keeping everybody not-self. Do you know why I didn't want to teach this course? It's insane."**

But then came the resolution:

**"Remember that we're never going to get rid of [the not-self] on this planet. There is always going to be these specific ways on the material plane that we live in to recognize where we can have impact and effect."**

## The Clean Path

The way to make money cleanly:
1. Be correct in your own decision-making
2. Use your open centers as wisdom, not as drivers
3. Offer genuine transformation and awakening
4. Recognize that everyone needs assistance
5. Accept that the material plane is dominated by not-self
6. Provide authentic service that transforms

**"When you're correct the work is honorable work. It's clean."**

## Final Note: It's Not About Money

Ra's most profound teaching:

**"Life is not about spending your time being concerned on the material plane. It's part of the illusion. And it's the densest illusion of the not-self."**

**"What I know about the grace of life is that if everyone were correct, everyone would have what's correct. Some would have just what they need. Some would have just a little bit more than they need. And some will have just a little bit more than that. That's all. It's never equal. It's just the way that it is. But everybody has a right to it."**

The material plane is a byproduct of living correctlyâ€”not the goal itself.
